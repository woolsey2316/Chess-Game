# Chess-Game
A chess game that can be played against the stockfish 9 chess engine or against another player in a peer-to-peer network.

# Analysis Mode 
During a chess game Analysis Mode scores various move sequences in terms of centipawns. The centipawn is the unit of measure used in chess as measure of the advantage. A centipawn is equal to 1/100 of a pawn. The pieces have usually an integer value in pawns, but using the centipawn allows strategic features of the position, worth less than a single pawn, to be evaluated without requiring fractions.

The following is the most common assignment of point values:

:The queen is worth 900 
:Each rook is worth 500; 
:Each knight is worth 300; 
:Each bishop is worth 300; 
:Each pawn is worth 100 centipawns.

The value of the king is undefined as it cannot be captured, let alone traded, during the course of the game. Some early computer chess programs gave the king an arbitrary large value (such as 100,000,000 centipawns) to indicate that the inevitable loss of the king due to checkmate trumps all other considerations.

# Checkmate Drills
Practice checkmating a lone king with your own king plus one or two pieces. Includes two rook mate, two bishop mate and the very challenging bishop and knight mate.
